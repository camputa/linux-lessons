# Wiki 1: Azure Boards

Azure Boards is a critical component of the Azure DevOps suite, designed to facilitate agile project management. Initially, it was a feature of Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), where it incorporated work item tracking and project management functionalities. Over time, as VSTS transitioned to Azure DevOps, Azure Boards was significantly enhanced to support modern agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. Its evolution includes improved integration with other Azure DevOps services and third-party tools, making it a comprehensive tool for managing the entire development lifecycle.

## Key Features

Azure Boards offers an extensive set of features designed to streamline agile project management. These features include work item tracking, backlogs, Kanban boards, sprint planning, and querying capabilities.

### Work Items

Azure Boards provides a robust system for tracking and managing various types of work items, including user stories, tasks, bugs, and issues. Work items can be customized to fit specific project needs, allowing teams to tailor the tool to their processes.

### Backlogs

Backlogs in Azure Boards help teams organize and prioritize work items. Product backlogs encompass high-level requirements, while iteration backlogs focus on tasks for a specific sprint or iteration. This structured approach ensures all work items are accounted for and progress is easily trackable.

### Kanban Boards

Kanban boards offer a visual way to manage work in progress. Teams can customize columns to reflect their workflow, use swimlanes to differentiate types of work, and adjust card styles for better visibility. This visualization helps teams identify bottlenecks and optimize processes.

### Sprint Planning

Sprint planning in Azure Boards includes tools for managing iterations, tracking capacity, and viewing sprint burndown charts. These features help teams plan their work for each sprint, ensuring they do not overcommit and can deliver high-quality work within the iteration timeframe.

### Queries

Azure Boards offers powerful querying capabilities. Teams can create custom queries to filter and find specific work items based on various criteria. Saved queries can be shared with team members, promoting transparency and collaboration.

## Getting Started

To begin using Azure Boards, navigate to the Azure DevOps portal and select the Boards option. From here, you can start creating and managing work items, organizing your backlogs, and setting up your Kanban boards and sprints. Customize your workflow and queries to fit your teamâ€™s needs and streamline your project management processes.
