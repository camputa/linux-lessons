# Wiki 4: Azure Test Plans

Azure Test Plans is a comprehensive test management solution within the Azure DevOps suite. Initially part of Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), it evolved from basic test case management to a full-featured platform supporting manual, exploratory, and automated testing. This evolution includes enhanced integration with other Azure DevOps services, offering a seamless testing experience within the CI/CD pipeline.

## Key Features

Azure Test Plans provides a wide range of features to support the testing process, including test case management, exploratory testing, and integration with automated testing frameworks.

### Test Case Management

Azure Test Plans allows teams to create, manage, and execute test cases. Test cases can be organized into test suites and plans, enabling structured testing and comprehensive coverage of application functionality. Teams can also link test cases to work items, ensuring traceability between requirements and testing efforts.

### Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing in Azure Test Plans supports ad-hoc testing sessions where testers can explore the application and document findings without predefined test cases. This approach is useful for discovering unexpected issues and gaining insights into application behavior.

### Integration with Automated Testing

Azure Test Plans integrates with various automated testing frameworks, such as Selenium and Appium. This integration allows teams to execute automated tests within their CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that code changes are thoroughly tested before deployment.

## Getting Started

To begin using Azure Test Plans, navigate to the Azure DevOps portal and select the Test Plans option. From here, you can create test plans and suites, define test cases, and start executing tests. Integrate your automated tests to enhance your testing strategy and improve application quality.
