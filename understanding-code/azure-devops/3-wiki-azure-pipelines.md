# Wiki 3: Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service within Azure DevOps. Originally part of Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure Pipelines has evolved to support a wide range of languages and platforms, integrating seamlessly with GitHub, Bitbucket, and other repository services. Over time, it has become a versatile tool for automating the build, test, and deployment processes, supporting both Windows and Linux environments.

## Key Features

Azure Pipelines offers robust features to automate the CI/CD process, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software faster and with greater reliability. These features include YAML pipelines, classic release pipelines, and integration with various third-party services.

### YAML Pipelines

YAML pipelines provide a code-centric approach to defining CI/CD workflows. Teams can create and version their pipeline definitions using YAML files, which are stored in the repository alongside the source code. This approach promotes transparency and collaboration, as pipeline configurations are versioned and can be reviewed just like code changes.

### Classic Release Pipelines

Classic release pipelines offer a visual editor for defining CI/CD workflows. Teams can create pipelines by dragging and dropping tasks and configuring stages in a graphical interface. This approach is ideal for those who prefer a more visual representation of their CI/CD process.

### Integration with Third-Party Services

Azure Pipelines integrates with numerous third-party services, such as Docker, Kubernetes, and various testing tools. This integration allows teams to build, test, and deploy applications using the tools and services they are already familiar with, enhancing their existing workflows.

## Getting Started

To begin using Azure Pipelines, navigate to the Azure DevOps portal and select the Pipelines option. From here, you can create new pipelines using either the YAML or classic editor. Connect your repository, configure your build and release stages, and start automating your CI/CD processes.

For more detailed information on using Azure Pipelines, refer to the [Azure Pipelines Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/).
