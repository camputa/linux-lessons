# Using Git Conventional Commits to Automate Processes

Git conventional commits provide a standardized format for commit messages, which can be leveraged to automate various processes, such as generating changelogs and determining the impact of changes. This enhances project management by ensuring consistent and informative commit messages, making it easier to track and communicate changes.

## Automating Changelog Generation

Changelogs are essential for documenting the history of changes in a project. By using conventional commits, we can automate the generation of changelogs, ensuring they are up-to-date and accurately reflect the changes made.

1. **Commit Message Standardization**:
   Using conventional commits standardizes commit messages, making it easier to parse them automatically. Each commit message follows a specific format, which can be used to categorize and list changes.

2. **Tools for Generating Changelogs**:
   Tools like `standard-version` or `conventional-changelog` can be used to automatically generate changelogs based on conventional commit messages.

   - **Standard Version**: This tool automates versioning and changelog generation. It reads the commit messages and generates a changelog based on the types of changes.
   - **Conventional Changelog**: This tool generates a changelog file based on conventional commit messages. It can be customized to fit the specific needs of a project.

### Steps to Automate Changelog Generation

1. **Install the Required Tools**:
   ```
   npm install -g standard-version
   ```

2. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. **Make Some Conventional Commits**:
   ```
   git commit -m "feat: add user login functionality"
   git commit -m "fix: correct password validation issue"
   git commit -m "docs: update README with login instructions"
   ```

4. **Generate the Changelog**:
   ```
   standard-version
   ```
   This command will create or update a `CHANGELOG.md` file with the categorized changes based on the commit messages.

5. **View the Changelog**:
   Open the `CHANGELOG.md` file to see the generated log. It will contain sections for features, fixes, and documentation changes.

## Determining the Impact of Changes

Conventional commits help in determining the impact of changes by clearly categorizing each commit. This makes it easier to identify major, minor, and patch-level changes.

1. **Commit Types**:
   Each commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`) indicates the nature of the change. For example:
   - `feat` indicates a new feature.
   - `fix` indicates a bug fix.
   - `BREAKING CHANGE` in the footer indicates a major change.

2. **Semantic Versioning**:
   By analyzing the commit messages, tools can determine the appropriate version bump (major, minor, patch). This ensures that versioning reflects the actual impact of changes.

3. **Automated Release Management**:
   Tools like `semantic-release` automate the entire release process by analyzing commit messages to determine the next version, generating release notes, and publishing the release.

### Steps to Automate Release Management

1. **Install Semantic Release**:
   ```
   npm install -g semantic-release
   ```

2. **Configure Semantic Release**:
   Create a configuration file (`.releaserc`) in the project root:
   ```json
   {
     "branches": ["main"],
     "plugins": [
       "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
       "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
       "@semantic-release/changelog",
       "@semantic-release/github",
       "@semantic-release/git"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Run Semantic Release**:
   ```
   npx semantic-release
   ```
   This command analyzes the commit messages, determines the next version, updates the changelog, and creates a new release on GitHub.

## Practical Hands-On Example

To practice using git conventional commits to automate processes, let's create a simple project where team members add features, fix bugs, and update documentation. We'll then generate a changelog and automate release management.

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   ```
   git init
   ```

2. **Create Initial Files**:
   ```
   echo "# Project" > README.md
   echo "console.log('Hello, world!');" > index.js
   ```

3. **Make Some Conventional Commits**:
   ```
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "docs: add project title to README"

   git add index.js
   git commit -m "feat: add initial console log"
   ```

4. **Install Standard Version**:
   ```
   npm install -g standard-version
   ```

5. **Generate the Changelog**:
   ```
   standard-version
   ```
   This command will create or update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the categorized changes based on the commit messages.

6. **Install Semantic Release**:
   ```
   npm install -g semantic-release
   ```

7. **Configure Semantic Release**:
   Create a `.releaserc` file in the project root with the necessary plugins.

8. **Run Semantic Release**:
   ```
   npx semantic-release
   ```

By following these steps, the team can practice using git conventional commits to automate changelog generation and release management, making the development process more efficient and organized.
