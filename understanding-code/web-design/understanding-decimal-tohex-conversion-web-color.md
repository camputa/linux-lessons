# **Understanding Decimal to HEX Calculations: Converting 255 to FF**

When working with colors in web development, you’ll often need to convert between decimal (base 10) and hexadecimal (base 16) systems, especially when switching between RGB and HEX color codes. A common conversion you’ll encounter is turning the decimal value `255` into its hexadecimal equivalent, `FF`.

## **What is Decimal and HEX?**

- **Decimal**: The standard numbering system used in everyday life, based on 10 digits (0-9).
- **HEX**: A numbering system used in computing that’s based on 16 digits, including 0-9 and A-F, where A-F represent the decimal values 10-15.

## **Converting 255 to FF**

To convert the decimal number `255` to HEX:

1. **Divide the number by 16**:  
   255 ÷ 16 = 15 with a remainder of 15.

2. **Determine the hexadecimal digits**:  
   - The quotient `15` is the first digit.
   - The remainder `15` is the second digit.

3. **Convert these digits to HEX**:  
   - Both `15` in decimal are `F` in HEX.

4. **Combine the digits**:  
   - The HEX equivalent of `255` is therefore `FF`.

## **Decimal to HEX Conversion Table**

To help you visualize the conversion process, here’s a horizontal table that shows decimal numbers 0-15 and their corresponding HEX values:

| **Decimal** | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|-------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **HEX**     | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  |

This table is a quick reference for converting single-digit decimal values to their HEX equivalents, which is essential when calculating more complex color codes.

## **Practice Conversions**

Here are some additional decimal to HEX conversions to practice:

1. **Decimal**: `200`  
   **HEX**: `C8`

2. **Decimal**: `128`  
   **HEX**: `80`

3. **Decimal**: `64`  
   **HEX**: `40`

4. **Decimal**: `15`  
   **HEX**: `0F`

5. **Decimal**: `10`  
   **HEX**: `0A`

Each of these conversions follows the same process as described above: divide by 16, find the quotient and remainder, convert to HEX, and combine the digits. These exercises will help you become comfortable with moving between decimal and hexadecimal systems, a crucial skill for working with CSS color codes in web development.
