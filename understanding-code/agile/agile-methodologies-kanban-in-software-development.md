# Kanban Methodology in Software Development

## History of Kanban

Kanban originated within the Toyota Production System (TPS) in the 1940s to improve efficiency by reducing waste and optimizing production processes. The term "Kanban" comes from the Japanese words "kan" (visual) and "ban" (card or board), emphasizing its foundation in visual management.

## Key Principles of Kanban

Kanban is based on several key principles that guide its implementation:

- **Visualize Work**: A Kanban board divided into columns representing stages like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" helps teams see the status of tasks at a glance.
- **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: Restricting the number of tasks in each stage prevents overloading team members and ensures a steady flow of work.
- **Manage Flow**: Ensuring tasks move smoothly through the process by monitoring metrics like cycle time (time to complete a task) and throughput (tasks completed in a timeframe).
- **Make Process Policies Explicit**: Clearly defining and sharing the rules and policies guiding the Kanban process.
- **Implement Feedback Loops**: Regular reviews and feedback sessions to improve the process.
- **Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (Kaizen)**: Continuous improvement through small, incremental changes.

## Kanban in Software Development Using Azure DevOps

### Setting Up a Kanban Board

In Azure DevOps, create a Kanban board to visualize your workflow. The board is divided into columns representing stages of the software development process, such as "Backlog," "In Progress," "Code Review," "Testing," and "Done." Tasks, bugs, user stories, or features are added as work items, each represented by a card that moves across the board as it progresses.

### Managing Work Items

Work items in Azure DevOps should include detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, and relevant information to ensure clarity. This detailed task management helps team members understand the work requirements and progress efficiently.

### Applying WIP Limits

Setting WIP limits for each column on the Kanban board helps control the number of tasks in progress. For instance, limiting the "Code Review" column to three tasks ensures that reviewers are not overwhelmed and can maintain high-quality standards. Regularly reviewing and adjusting these limits based on team capacity and workflow can prevent bottlenecks and improve efficiency.

## Managing Flow

Kanban aims to create a smooth flow of tasks through the process, minimizing bottlenecks and delays. This continuous flow is monitored using metrics like cycle time, which measures the time taken to complete a task, and throughput, which tracks the number of tasks completed within a specific timeframe. Regular reviews and adjustments based on these metrics help maintain an optimal workflow.

### Sample WIP and Flow

- **WIP Limits**:
  - "Backlog": Unlimited
  - "In Progress": Maximum of 5 tasks
  - "Code Review": Maximum of 3 tasks
  - "Testing": Maximum of 2 tasks
- **Flow Metrics**:
  - **Cycle Time**: Average time for a task to move from "In Progress" to "Done."
  - **Throughput**: Number of tasks completed per week.

## Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)

Kanban encourages continuous improvement, known as Kaizen, through regular reviews and process adjustments. Teams should conduct retrospectives to evaluate the Kanban process, identify areas for improvement, and implement changes. This iterative approach ensures that the workflow remains efficient and effective, adapting to the team's evolving needs and challenges. Kaizen emphasizes small, incremental changes that collectively lead to significant improvements over time.

## Roles, Events, and Artifacts in Kanban

### Roles

- **Team Members**: Everyone involved in the development process who work on tasks and move them across the board.
- **Service Delivery Manager**: Ensures the Kanban system is working smoothly and facilitates continuous improvement.
- **Product Owner**: Manages the backlog, prioritizes tasks, and ensures that the team is working on the most valuable items.

### Events

- **Daily Standup**: A brief daily meeting to discuss progress, identify blockers, and plan the day's work.
- **Replenishment Meeting**: Regularly scheduled meeting to review and prioritize the backlog.
- **Retrospective**: Periodic review to evaluate the Kanban process and identify improvement opportunities.

### Artifacts

- **Kanban Board**: Visual tool to manage and track the flow of tasks.
- **Work Items**: Tasks, bugs, user stories, or features represented by cards on the Kanban board.
- **WIP Limits**: Constraints on the number of tasks in each stage to maintain focus and flow.
