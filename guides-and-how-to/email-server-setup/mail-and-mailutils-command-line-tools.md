## 5. **Troubleshooting Tips**

### 5.1 **Emails Not Sending**

- **Check Mail Server Configuration**: Ensure that your mail server (Postfix, Exim, etc.) is correctly configured and running.
  ```bash
  systemctl status postfix
  ```
- **Check `/var/log/mail.log`**: Review the mail log for errors.
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/mail.log
  ```

### 5.2 **Emails Not Being Received**

- **Check Spam Filters**: Ensure the emails are not being filtered to the spam folder.
- **Test with Different Recipients**: Try sending emails to different domains (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) to identify if the issue is domain-specific.

### 5.3 **Attachments Not Being Delivered**

- **Check Attachment Size**: Ensure the file size does not exceed the maximum limit set by your mail server.
- **Check File Permissions**: Ensure the file is readable by the user running the `mail` command.

## 6. **Best Practices**

### 6.1 **Secure Your Emails**

- **Use SSL/TLS**: Ensure your mail server is configured to use SSL/TLS for sending emails securely.
- **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials**: Never hardcode email server credentials in scripts. Use environment variables or secure vaults.

### 6.2 **Log and Monitor Emails**

- **Enable Logging**: Keep detailed logs of sent emails, especially in automated scripts.
- **Monitor Server Health**: Regularly monitor the health and performance of your mail server.

### 6.3 **Automate Routine Tasks**

- **Cron Jobs**: Use cron jobs to automate routine email tasks like sending daily reports or system alerts.

### 6.4 **Test Before Deployment**

- **Test Configuration**: Always test your email configuration in a staging environment before deploying to production.
