## Let's Get Started!

### 1. Understanding the `tar` Command

**Objective:**
To create and extract tarball archives using the `tar` command.

**Commands and Options:**

- **tar** (Tape Archive)
  - `tar [options] [archive-file] [file or directory]` - General syntax
  - **Common Options:**
    - `-c` - Create a new archive
    - `-x` - Extract files from an archive
    - `-f` - Specify the archive file name
    - `-v` - Verbose mode (show progress)
    - `-z` - Compress the archive with gzip
    - `-j` - Compress the archive with bzip2
    - `-t` - List the contents of an archive

**Sample Commands:**

1. **Create a tarball archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -cvf archive.tar mydir/
   ```

2. **Create a gzipped tarball archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -czvf archive.tar.gz mydir/
   ```

3. **Extract a tarball archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -xvf archive.tar
   ```

4. **Extract a gzipped tarball archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz
   ```

5. **List contents of a tarball archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -tvf archive.tar
   ```

**Sample Output:**

```plaintext
mydir/
mydir/file1.txt
mydir/file2.txt
```

### 2. Understanding the `zip` Command

**Objective:**
To compress files and directories using the `zip` command.

**Commands and Options:**

- **zip** (Package and compress files)
  - `zip [options] [archive-file] [file or directory]` - General syntax
  - **Common Options:**
    - `-r` - Recursively zip files
    - `-v` - Verbose mode (show progress)
    - `-e` - Encrypt the archive

**Sample Commands:**

1. **Create a zip archive:**

   ```bash
   zip archive.zip file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

2. **Create a zip archive of a directory:**

   ```bash
   zip -r archive.zip mydir/
   ```

3. **Create an encrypted zip archive:**

   ```bash
   zip -e archive.zip file1.txt
   ```

**Sample Output:**

```plaintext
  adding: file1.txt (stored 0%)
  adding: file2.txt (stored 0%)
```

### 3. Understanding the `unzip` Command

**Objective:**
To decompress zip archives using the `unzip` command.

**Commands and Options:**

- **unzip** (Extract compressed files)
  - `unzip [options] [archive-file]` - General syntax
  - **Common Options:**
    - `-l` - List contents of the archive
    - `-d` - Extract files to a specified directory

**Sample Commands:**

1. **Extract a zip archive:**

   ```bash
   unzip archive.zip
   ```

2. **List contents of a zip archive:**

   ```bash
   unzip -l archive.zip
   ```

3. **Extract files to a specified directory:**

   ```bash
   unzip archive.zip -d mydir/
   ```

**Sample Output:**

```plaintext
  inflating: file1.txt
  inflating: file2.txt
```

## Practice Tutorial

**Objective:**
Apply your knowledge through practical tasks.

**Task:**

1. **Create a new directory and some files:**

   ```bash
   mkdir myproject
   cd myproject
   touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
   ```

2. **Create a tarball archive of the directory:**

   ```bash
   tar -cvf myproject.tar myproject/
   ```

3. **Compress the tarball archive with gzip:**

   ```bash
   tar -czvf myproject.tar.gz myproject/
   ```

4. **List the contents of the gzipped tarball archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -tzvf myproject.tar.gz
   ```

5. **Extract the gzipped tarball archive:**

   ```bash
   tar -xzvf myproject.tar.gz
   ```

6. **Create a zip archive of the directory:**

   ```bash
   zip -r myproject.zip myproject/
   ```

7. **List the contents of the zip archive:**

   ```bash
   unzip -l myproject.zip
   ```

8. **Extract the zip archive to a new directory:**

   ```bash
   unzip myproject.zip -d myproject_extracted/
   ```

9. **Verify the extracted files:**

   ```bash
   ls myproject_extracted/
   ```
