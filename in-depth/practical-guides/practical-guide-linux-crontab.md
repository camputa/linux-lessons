## Let's Get Started!

### 1. What is `crontab`?

`crontab` is short for "cron table." It is a configuration file that specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule. The `cron` daemon on Unix-like operating systems reads the `crontab` files and executes the commands at specified times.

### 2. Understanding `crontab` Syntax

A `crontab` file has five fields for specifying time intervals, followed by the command to be executed:

```
*     *     *     *     *     command to be executed
-     -     -     -     -
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     +----- day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7)
|     |     |     +------- month (1 - 12)
|     |     +--------- day of the month (1 - 31)
|     +----------- hour (0 - 23)
+------------- minute (0 - 59)
```

- `*` means every possible value
- `,` separates multiple values
- `-` specifies a range
- `/` specifies increments

### 3. Common Options and Usage

- **`crontab -e`**: Edit the `crontab` file for the current user.
- **`crontab -l`**: List the `crontab` entries for the current user.
- **`crontab -r`**: Remove the `crontab` file for the current user.
- **`crontab -u [username]`**: Specify a user when listing or editing `crontab` entries (requires root privileges).

### 4. Practical Examples

Let's go through some examples to help you get hands-on with `crontab`.

#### Example 1: Schedule a Script to Run Every Day at Midnight

1. Create a script to be executed. Save it as `daily_backup.sh`:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    tar -czf /backup/wordpress/website_backup_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz -C /var/www/website/ .
    ```

2. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x daily_backup.sh
    ```

3. Edit the `crontab` file:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

4. Add the following line to schedule the script to run daily at midnight:

    ```bash
    0 0 * * * /path/to/daily_backup.sh
    ```

#### Example 2: Run a Command Every Monday at 3 AM

1. Edit the `crontab` file:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add the following line:

    ```bash
    0 3 * * 1 /usr/bin/weekly_maintenance.sh
    ```

#### Example 3: Check Disk Space Every Hour and Log it

1. Create a script to check disk space. Save it as `check_disk.sh`:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    df -h > /var/log/disk_usage.log
    ```

2. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x check_disk.sh
    ```

3. Edit the `crontab` file:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

4. Add the following line to run the script every hour:

    ```bash
    0 * * * * /path/to/check_disk.sh
    ```

#### Example 4: Use `crontab` Options for More Control

- **Specifying a range:** Run a script every day from 1 AM to 3 AM:

    ```bash
    0 1-3 * * * /path/to/script.sh
    ```

- **Running multiple times in an hour:** Run a command every 10 minutes:

    ```bash
    */10 * * * * /path/to/command.sh
    ```

#### Example 5: Combining with Other Commands

- **Emailing the output of a script:** Schedule a script and email its output:

    ```bash
    0 6 * * * /path/to/script.sh | mail -s "Daily Report" your-email@example.com
    ```

- **Using environment variables:** Define variables at the top of `crontab`:

    ```bash
    MAILTO=your-email@example.com
    SHELL=/bin/bash
    0 6 * * * /path/to/script.sh
    ```

## Practice Tutorial

Let's put what we've learned into practice with a tutorial.

**Objective:** Schedule a daily backup, monitor disk usage, and send a report via email.

1. **Create a Backup Script:**
    - Create `daily_backup.sh`:

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        tar -czf /backup/wordpress/website_backup_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz -C /var/www/website/ .
        ```

    - Make it executable:

        ```bash
        chmod +x daily_backup.sh
        ```

2. **Create a Disk Usage Script:**
    - Create `check_disk.sh`:

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        df -h > /var/log/disk_usage.log
        ```

    - Make it executable:

        ```bash
        chmod +x check_disk.sh
        ```

3. **Edit `crontab`:**
    - Open `crontab`:

        ```bash
        crontab -e
        ```

    - Add the following lines:

        ```bash
        # Daily backup at midnight
        0 0 * * * /path/to/daily_backup.sh

        # Check disk usage every hour
        0 * * * * /path/to/check_disk.sh

        # Email disk usage report every day at 6 AM
        0 6 * * * cat /var/log/disk_usage.log | mail -s "Daily Disk Usage Report" your-email@example.com
        ```
