## Let's Get Started!

### Introduction to User Access Logs

**Objective:**
Understand the purpose and significance of user access logs in maintaining system security.

**Overview:**
User access logs are crucial for tracking user activity on a system. They help in monitoring who accessed the system, when, and what actions were performed. This information is vital for detecting unauthorized access, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring compliance with security policies.

### Displaying User Access Logs

**Objective:**
Learn how to display user access logs using various Linux commands.

**Steps:**

1. **View Authentication Logs:**
   The `/var/log/auth.log` file contains authentication-related messages, including successful and failed login attempts.

   ```bash
   sudo tail /var/log/auth.log
   ```

2. **Check the Last Logins:**
   The `last` command shows a list of the most recent login sessions.

   ```bash
   last
   ```

3. **Check Failed Login Attempts:**
   The `lastb` command displays a list of failed login attempts. This requires the `btmp` log file.

   ```bash
   sudo lastb
   ```

4. **View Secure Logs:**
   On some systems, secure logs are stored in `/var/log/secure`.

   ```bash
   sudo tail /var/log/secure
   ```

5. **Check System Log Messages:**
   The `/var/log/messages` file contains system log messages, including login attempts.

   ```bash
   sudo tail /var/log/messages
   ```

### Analyzing Log Files

**Objective:**
Gain proficiency in analyzing log files to identify potential security threats and system issues.

**Steps:**

1. **Use `grep` to Search Logs:**
   Use the `grep` command to search for specific keywords or patterns in log files.

   ```bash
   sudo grep 'sshd' /var/log/auth.log
   ```

2. **Filter Logs by Date:**
   Use the `awk` command to filter logs by date.

   ```bash
   sudo awk '/Jul 20/ {print}' /var/log/auth.log
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs in Real-Time:**
   Use the `tail -f` command to monitor logs in real-time.

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
   ```

4. **Count Specific Entries:**
   Use `grep` with the `-c` option to count specific entries, such as failed login attempts.

   ```bash
   sudo grep -c 'Failed password' /var/log/auth.log
   ```

### Intrusion Detection Techniques

**Objective:**
Learn basic intrusion detection techniques to identify and respond to potential security threats.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Repeated Failed Login Attempts:**
   Check for repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address.

   ```bash
   sudo grep 'Failed password' /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   ```

2. **Check for Unauthorized Root Access Attempts:**
   Look for attempts to gain root access without permission.

   ```bash
   sudo grep 'sudo: ' /var/log/auth.log
   ```

3. **Monitor SSH Login Attempts:**
   Analyze SSH login attempts and identify unusual activity.

   ```bash
   sudo grep 'sshd' /var/log/auth.log
   ```

4. **Set Up Logwatch for Daily Reports:**
   Install and configure Logwatch to receive daily email reports on system activity.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install logwatch
   sudo logwatch --detail High --mailto your_email@example.com --range All
   ```

5. **Use Fail2Ban for Automated Protection:**
   Install Fail2Ban to automatically ban IPs with multiple failed login attempts.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install fail2ban
   sudo systemctl start fail2ban
   sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
   ```

## Practical Tutorial

**Objective:**
Apply the knowledge gained to perform practical tasks using log analysis commands.

**Task:**

1. **Monitor Authentication Logs in Real-Time:**

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
   ```

2. **Search for Failed Login Attempts:**

   ```bash
   sudo grep 'Failed password' /var/log/auth.log
   ```

3. **Count Failed Login Attempts:**

   ```bash
   sudo grep -c 'Failed password' /var/log/auth.log
   ```

4. **Identify Most Frequent IPs in Failed Attempts:**

   ```bash
   sudo grep 'Failed password' /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   ```
