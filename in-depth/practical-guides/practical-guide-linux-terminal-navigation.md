## Let's Get Started!

### Basic Navigation Commands

**Objective:**
To navigate the Linux file system efficiently using fundamental commands.

**Commands and Options:**

- **ls** (List directory contents)
  - `ls -l`: List in long format
  - `ls -a`: List all files, including hidden ones
  - `ls -h`: List with human-readable file sizes
  ```bash
  ls -lah
  ```
  **Sample Output:**
  ```plaintext
  total 28K
  drwxr-xr-x  4 user user 4.0K Jul 17 10:00 .
  drwxr-xr-x 24 user user 4.0K Jul 17 10:00 ..
  -rw-r--r--  1 user user  220 Jul 17 10:00 .bash_logout
  -rw-r--r--  1 user user 3.7K Jul 17 10:00 .bashrc
  drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4.0K Jul 17 10:00 Documents
  ```

- **pwd** (Print working directory)
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
  **Sample Output:**
  ```plaintext
  /home/user
  ```

- **cd** (Change directory)
  - `cd ~`: Go to the home directory
  - `cd ../`: Move up one directory
  - `cd .`: Stay in the current directory
  ```bash
  cd ~
  cd ../
  cd .
  ```

### File and Directory Management

**Objective:**
To create, manage, and remove files and directories.

**Commands and Options:**

- **mkdir** (Make directory)
  ```bash
  mkdir my_directory
  ```

- **rmdir** (Remove directory)
  ```bash
  rmdir my_directory
  ```

- **touch** (Create an empty file or update the timestamp)
  ```bash
  touch my_file.txt
  ```

- **rm** (Remove files or directories)
  - `rm -r`: Remove directories and their contents recursively
  - `rm -f`: Force removal without prompting
  ```bash
  rm my_file.txt
  rm -rf my_directory
  ```

### Linking Files and Directories

**Objective:**
To create hard and symbolic links between files and directories.

**Commands and Options:**

- **ln** (Create links)
  - `ln file1 file2`: Create a hard link
  - `ln -s target link_name`: Create a symbolic link
  ```bash
  ln my_file.txt hard_link.txt
  ln -s my_file.txt soft_link.txt
  ```

### Displaying and Manipulating File Contents

**Objective:**
To display, concatenate, and manipulate file contents.

**Commands and Options:**

- **echo** (Display a line of text)
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, Team!" > hello.txt
  ```

- **cat** (Concatenate and display file contents)
  ```bash
  cat hello.txt
  ```
  **Sample Output:**
  ```plaintext
  Hello, Team!
  ```

- **grep** (Search for patterns within files)
  ```bash
  grep "Hello" hello.txt
  ```
  **Sample Output:**
  ```plaintext
  Hello, Team!
  ```

### Searching for Files and Directories

**Objective:**
To locate files and directories using powerful search commands.

**Commands and Options:**

- **find** (Search for files and directories)
  - `find . -name "hello.txt"`: Search for a file named "hello.txt" in the current directory and subdirectories
  - `find /home -user username`: Find files owned by the specified user in the /home directory
  - `find /var -mtime -1`: Find files in the /var directory modified within the last 24 hours
  - `find /etc -size +1M`: Find files in the /etc directory larger than 1MB
  ```bash
  find . -name "hello.txt"
  find /home -user username
  find /var -mtime -1
  find /etc -size +1M
  ```
  **Sample Outputs:**
  ```plaintext
  ./hello.txt
  /home/username/.bashrc
  /var/log/syslog
  /etc/largefile.conf
  ```

## Practice Tutorial

**Objective:**
Apply your knowledge through practical tasks.

**Task:**

1. **Navigate to the home directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```

2. **Create a new directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir dev_environment
   ```

3. **Navigate into the new directory:**
   ```bash
   cd dev_environment
   ```

4. **Create an empty file:**
   ```bash
   touch sample.txt
   ```

5. **Display the current directory:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

6. **Create a symbolic link to the new file:**
   ```bash
   ln -s sample.txt link_to_sample.txt
   ```

7. **Write text to the file using echo:**
   ```bash
   echo "This is a sample file." > sample.txt
   ```

8. **Display the file contents using cat:**
   ```bash
   cat sample.txt
   ```

9. **Search for the text within the file using grep:**
   ```bash
   grep "sample" sample.txt
   ```

10. **Find the file within the directory:**
    ```bash
    find . -name "sample.txt"
