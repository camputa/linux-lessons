Welcome to your exciting journey into email server management! Setting up a secure email server on Ubuntu 20.04 with Postfix, Dovecot, and Roundcube Webmail is a fantastic way to gain control over your email communications and enhance your technical skills. This guide will walk you through each step, ensuring you understand every aspect of the setup process. Let’s dive in!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you will:
- Install and configure Postfix for handling email delivery.
- Set up Dovecot for email retrieval and management.
- Configure Roundcube Webmail for a user-friendly web-based email interface.
- Secure your email server with TLS/SSL encryption.
- Implement best practices for maintaining a secure and reliable email server.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have:
- An Ubuntu 20.04 server with root or sudo access.
- A domain name (e.g., `example.com`) and appropriate DNS records (MX, A, and PTR records).
- Basic knowledge of Linux command-line operations.

## Step 1: Install and Configure Postfix

Postfix is a powerful and versatile mail transfer agent (MTA) used for routing and delivering emails. To get started, install Postfix on your server with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postfix
```

During installation, you’ll be prompted to choose a configuration type. Select "Internet Site" and enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`) when asked. Postfix will use this domain to send and receive emails.

### Basic Configuration

The main configuration file for Postfix is located at `/etc/postfix/main.cf`. Open it for editing:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
```

Here are some key settings to include in your configuration:

- **`myhostname`**: Set this to your server’s fully qualified domain name (FQDN), e.g., `mail.example.com`.
- **`myorigin`**: Define the domain name that Postfix uses in email addresses, e.g., `example.com`.
- **`mydestination`**: Specify the domains that Postfix will accept mail for, e.g., `$myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain`.
- **`inet_interfaces`**: Define the network interfaces to listen on. Set this to `all` to listen on all interfaces.
- **`smtpd_tls_security_level`**: Enforce TLS encryption for SMTP connections. Set this to `may` to allow but not enforce TLS.

Here’s an example configuration snippet:

```plaintext
myhostname = mail.example.com
myorigin = example.com
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all
smtpd_tls_security_level = may
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/certs/postfix.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/private/postfix.key
```

### Postfix Security Enhancements

To enhance security, you should set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. These records help prevent email spoofing and ensure your emails are authenticated.

- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Add a TXT record to your DNS settings like this:

  ```plaintext
  v=spf1 mx a ip4:192.168.1.1 -all
  ```

  This record specifies which IP addresses are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.

- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Install `opendkim` and configure it to sign your emails. Install it with:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install opendkim opendkim-tools
  ```

  Configure DKIM by adding the following to `/etc/opendkim.conf`:

  ```plaintext
  Domain                  example.com
  KeyFile                  /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com/default.private
  Selector                 default
  AutoRestart              Yes
  AutoRestartRate          10/1h
  Syslog                   Yes
  UMask                    002
  ```

  Generate a DKIM key pair and add the public key to your DNS records.

- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)**: Add a TXT record like:

  ```plaintext
  _dmarc.example.com IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com"
  ```

## Step 2: Install and Configure Dovecot

Dovecot is a robust IMAP and POP3 server that manages email retrieval and storage. To install Dovecot, use:

```bash
sudo apt install dovecot-core dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d dovecot-pop3d dovecot-sieve
```

### Basic Configuration

The main configuration file for Dovecot is `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf`. Open it for editing:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
```

Ensure the following settings are included:

- **`mail_location`**: Define where Dovecot stores user mail. For instance:

  ```plaintext
  mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
  ```

- **`ssl_cert` and `ssl_key`**: Specify the paths to your SSL certificate and key files for encrypted connections:

  ```plaintext
  ssl_cert = </etc/ssl/certs/dovecot.pem
  ssl_key = </etc/ssl/private/dovecot.key
  ```

### Enabling User Authentication

Edit `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf` to configure authentication mechanisms. For example:

```plaintext
auth_mechanisms = plain login
```

You can also configure Dovecot to use MySQL or PostgreSQL databases for user authentication by installing the appropriate plugins and editing `/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext`.

## Step 3: Install and Configure Roundcube Webmail

Roundcube provides a user-friendly web interface for managing emails. To install it, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt install roundcube roundcube-core roundcube-mysql
```

During installation, you'll be asked to configure the database. Select "Yes" and follow the prompts to set up a database for Roundcube.

### Configuring Roundcube

Edit the Roundcube configuration file at `/etc/roundcube/config.inc.php`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/roundcube/config.inc.php
```

Add your mail server settings. Here’s a basic configuration example:

```php
$config['default_host'] = 'ssl://mail.example.com';
$config['default_port'] = 993;
$config['smtp_server'] = 'ssl://mail.example.com';
$config['smtp_port'] = 465;
$config['smtp_user'] = '%u';
$config['smtp_pass'] = '%p';
$config['smtp_auth_type'] = 'LOGIN';
$config['smtp_helo_host'] = 'example.com';
```

This configuration tells Roundcube to connect to your Postfix server via SSL for IMAP and SMTP.

### Securing Roundcube

To secure Roundcube, ensure it’s only accessible over HTTPS. Configure your web server (Apache or Nginx) to enforce SSL:

For Apache, you can set up SSL in your virtual host configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/sites-available/roundcube.conf`):

```plaintext
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName mail.example.com
    DocumentRoot /usr/share/roundcube
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/roundcube.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/roundcube.key
    <Directory /usr/share/roundcube>
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Restart Apache to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Testing and Maintenance

After setting up your server, test it thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected:

- **Send and receive test emails** using a mail client or webmail interface.
- **Check mail logs** for any errors or issues. Logs are located in `/var/log/mail.log` or `/var/log/mail.err`.

Regularly maintain your server by keeping software updated, monitoring logs, and backing up your configuration files and email data.
