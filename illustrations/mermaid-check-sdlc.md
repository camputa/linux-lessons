Here is a Mermaid diagram to illustrate a multi-website Apache2 web server setup in three SDLC environments (DEV, QA, and Production), with deployment gates and checkpoints between the environments:

### Description of the Diagram:

- **Development Environment**: Contains three websites (Site 1, Site 2, Site 3) in the DEV environment.
- **Deployment Gate**: A checkpoint for code review and testing before moving to QA.
- **QA Environment**: Contains three websites (Site 1, Site 2, Site 3) in the QA environment.
- **Deployment Checkpoint**: Consists of automated and manual tests before moving to production.
- **Production Environment**: Contains three websites (Site 1, Site 2, Site 3) in the Production environment.

This diagram represents the flow of the development process from DEV to QA to Production, including the necessary gates and checkpoints to ensure quality and approval at each stage.
