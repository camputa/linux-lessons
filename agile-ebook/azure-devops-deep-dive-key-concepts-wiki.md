### Wiki 1: Azure Boards

#### History and Evolution

Azure Boards is a critical component of the Azure DevOps suite, designed to facilitate agile project management. Initially, it was a feature of Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), where it incorporated work item tracking and project management functionalities. Over time, as VSTS transitioned to Azure DevOps, Azure Boards was significantly enhanced to support modern agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. Its evolution includes improved integration with other Azure DevOps services and third-party tools, making it a comprehensive tool for managing the entire development lifecycle.

#### 1. Key Features

Azure Boards offers an extensive set of features designed to streamline agile project management. These features include work item tracking, backlogs, Kanban boards, sprint planning, and querying capabilities.

##### 1.1 Work Items

Azure Boards provides a robust system for tracking and managing various types of work items, including user stories, tasks, bugs, and issues. Work items can be customized to fit specific project needs, allowing teams to tailor the tool to their processes.

### Wiki 2: Azure Repos

#### History and Evolution

Azure Repos is a source code management system within the Azure DevOps suite, supporting both Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). It has its roots in Team Foundation Server (TFS) and later Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). Over time, Azure Repos has evolved into a robust version control system that supports modern development practices, including branching strategies, pull requests, and CI/CD integrations.

#### 2. Key Features

Azure Repos allows teams to create and manage Git repositories, providing a central location for storing and versioning source code. With Git repositories, teams can leverage branching and merging to manage changes to the codebase effectively. This facilitates parallel development, feature isolation, and experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

##### 2.1 Pull Requests

Pull requests in Azure Repos enable code review and collaboration. Developers can submit pull requests to propose changes, which team members can review, comment on, and approve. This process ensures that code is reviewed for quality and consistency before being merged into the main branch. Additionally, policies can be set to require certain conditions, such as passing builds or specific reviewers, before a pull request can be merged.

![Pull Requests](placeholder1)
*Figure 2.1: Pull Requests Interface*

##### 2.2 Branch Policies

Branch policies in Azure Repos help enforce standards and practices within the codebase. These policies can include requirements for code review, build validation, and status checks. By enforcing these policies, teams can maintain high code quality and prevent issues from being introduced into the main branch.

![Branch Policies](placeholder2)
*Figure 2.2: Branch Policies*

##### 2.3 Code Search

Azure Repos offers a powerful code search feature that allows teams to search across repositories to find specific code, references, and definitions. Advanced search syntax helps refine search results, making it easier to locate the necessary code quickly.

### Wiki 5: Azure Artifacts

#### History and Evolution

Azure Artifacts is a package management solution within the Azure DevOps suite, designed to help teams manage and share code dependencies. Originally part of Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure Artifacts has evolved to support multiple package types, including NuGet, npm, Maven, and Python packages. This evolution includes enhanced security features and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making it a versatile tool for managing project dependencies.

#### 5. Key Features

Azure Artifacts provides robust features for managing and sharing packages, including feeds, upstream sources, and retention policies.

##### 5.1 Feeds

Feeds in Azure Artifacts allow teams to create and manage collections of packages. Teams can publish packages to feeds and control access to these packages, ensuring that only authorized users can consume them. Feeds can be scoped to a project or organization, providing flexibility in how packages are shared and managed.

![Feeds](placeholder1)
*Figure 5.1: Feeds Interface*

##### 5.2 Upstream Sources

Upstream sources enable teams to consume packages from external sources, such as public registries or other Azure Artifacts feeds. This feature simplifies dependency management by allowing teams to access all required packages from a single feed, reducing the need to configure multiple package sources.

![Upstream Sources](placeholder2)
*Figure 5.2: Upstream Sources*

##### 5.3 Retention Policies

Retention policies in Azure Artifacts help manage the lifecycle of packages by automatically cleaning up older versions based on predefined criteria. This feature ensures that feeds do not become cluttered with obsolete packages, maintaining a clean and efficient package repository.

![Retention Policies](placeholder3)
