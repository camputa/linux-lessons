# Agile Methodologies: Scrum and Kanban with Azure Work Items

## Introduction

Agile methodologies are popular frameworks in software development that emphasize iterative progress, collaboration, and flexibility. Scrum and Kanban are two widely-used Agile methodologies that help teams manage their work and deliver value efficiently. Azure DevOps supports these methodologies through its Azure Boards, which facilitate the creation and management of work items such as user stories, tasks, bugs, and issues. This wiki provides an overview of Scrum and Kanban, the history and differences between work items, and how your team can effectively use them in Azure DevOps.

## Agile Methodologies Overview

### Scrum

Scrum is a structured Agile framework that organizes work into fixed-length iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Scrum emphasizes roles, events, and artifacts to facilitate effective project management and team collaboration.

#### Key Roles
1. **Product Owner**: Defines the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and ensures the team delivers value.
2. **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures the team follows Agile practices.
3. **Development Team**: Cross-functional members who design, build, and test the product.

#### Key Events
1. **Sprint Planning**: Defines the goals and tasks for the upcoming sprint.
2. **Daily Stand-Up**: Short daily meetings to discuss progress, plans, and impediments.
3. **Sprint Review**: Demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback.
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflects on the sprint to identify improvements for future sprints.

#### Key Artifacts
1. **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of work items that need to be completed.
2. **Sprint Backlog**: The subset of the product backlog selected for the current sprint.
3. **Increment**: The sum of all completed work items that meet the Definition of Done.

### Kanban

Kanban is a flexible Agile methodology that visualizes work, limits work-in-progress (WIP), and focuses on continuous delivery. Unlike Scrum, Kanban does not prescribe specific roles or iterations.

#### Key Principles
1. **Visualize Work**: Use a Kanban board to display work items and their status.
2. **Limit Work-In-Progress**: Set WIP limits to prevent overloading the team.
3. **Manage Flow**: Monitor and optimize the flow of work through the system.
4. **Make Process Policies Explicit**: Clearly define and communicate process rules.
5. **Implement Feedback Loops**: Regularly review and adapt the process based on feedback.
6. **Improve Collaboratively**: Continuously improve through team collaboration and experimentation.

#### Key Elements
1. **Kanban Board**: A visual board with columns representing different stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
2. **Work Items**: Cards representing individual tasks, user stories, bugs, or issues.
3. **WIP Limits**: Constraints on the number of work items in each column to maintain focus and flow.

## Azure Work Items

Azure DevOps provides various work items to support Scrum and Kanban methodologies, enabling teams to track and manage their work effectively.

### Types of Work Items

1. **User Stories**: Describes a feature or functionality from the end user's perspective. It is typically written in the format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]."
   - **Usage**: User stories help teams understand the value of a feature and break down work into manageable chunks.
   - **Example**: "As a customer, I want to be able to track my order status so that I can stay informed about my delivery."

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
       A[Product Owner] -->|Defines User Story| B[User Story]
       B -->|Discussed by| C[Development Team]
       C -->|Implements| D[Feature]
   ```

2. **Tasks**: Represents a specific piece of work that needs to be done to complete a user story or bug.
   - **Usage**: Tasks help break down user stories into actionable steps, making it easier to track progress and assign responsibilities.
   - **Example**: "Design the order tracking page UI."

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
       A[User Story] -->|Broken into| B[Tasks]
       B -->|Assigned to| C[Team Members]
       C -->|Complete Tasks| D[User Story Completion]
   ```

3. **Bugs**: Indicates a defect or issue in the software that needs to be fixed.
   - **Usage**: Bugs are tracked and prioritized to ensure product quality and address any issues promptly.
   - **Example**: "Fix the login button not responding on the mobile app."

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
       A[User] -->|Reports| B[Bug]
       B -->|Triaged by| C[Development Team]
       C -->|Fixed and Verified| D[Resolution]
   ```

4. **Issues**: Represents a problem or impediment that needs to be addressed but may not be directly related to a specific user story or task.
   - **Usage**: Issues help identify and track non-functional requirements, risks, or impediments affecting the project.
   - **Example**: "Resolve performance issues on the server."

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
       A[Team Member] -->|Logs| B[Issue]
       B -->|Analyzed by| C[Team Lead]
       C -->|Assigned for Resolution| D[Team Members]
   ```

### History and Evolution of Work Items

Work items have evolved from simple task lists to sophisticated tools that support complex project management and collaboration needs. Initially, work items were basic to-do lists or bug trackers. As Agile methodologies gained popularity, the need for more structured and collaborative tools emerged, leading to the development of user stories, tasks, bugs, and issues as distinct work items.

Azure DevOps has continuously evolved to support these work items, integrating features like custom fields, templates, and workflows to enhance flexibility and usability. The evolution of work items reflects the growing complexity of software projects and the need for robust tools to manage them effectively.

### Using Azure Work Items

#### User Stories

1. **Create User Stories**: Define user stories in Azure Boards to capture features or functionalities from the end user's perspective.
2. **Prioritize User Stories**: Use the product backlog to prioritize user stories based on business value and customer needs.
3. **Discuss and Refine**: Collaborate with the development team to discuss and refine user stories, ensuring they are well-understood and actionable.

#### Tasks

1. **Break Down User Stories**: Create tasks to break down user stories into smaller, actionable steps.
2. **Assign Tasks**: Assign tasks to team members based on their skills and availability.
3. **Track Progress**: Use the sprint backlog or Kanban board to track task progress and ensure timely completion.

#### Bugs

1. **Report Bugs**: Log bugs in Azure Boards to document defects or issues found during testing or user feedback.
2. **Prioritize and Assign**: Prioritize bugs based on severity and impact, and assign them to developers for resolution.
3. **Verify Fixes**: Ensure bugs are fixed and verified before closing them to maintain product quality.

#### Issues

1. **Identify Issues**: Document issues affecting the project, such as technical debts, risks, or impediments.
2. **Analyze and Prioritize**: Analyze issues to understand their impact and prioritize them for resolution.
3. **Track and Resolve**: Use Azure Boards to track issue resolution and ensure they are addressed promptly.

### Learning the Terminology

1. **Sprint**: A fixed-length iteration in Scrum where a specific set of work items are completed.
2. **Backlog**: A prioritized list of work items (user stories, tasks, bugs, issues) to be completed.
3. **Kanban Board**: A visual board used in Kanban to display work items and their status.
4. **WIP Limit**: A constraint in Kanban that limits the number of work items in a particular stage to maintain focus and flow.

### Getting Comfortable with Azure Work Items

1. **Training Sessions**: Organize training sessions to familiarize team members with Azure Boards, work item types, and Agile methodologies.
2. **Hands-On Practice**: Encourage team members to create, manage, and track work items in Azure DevOps to build confidence and proficiency.
3. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews and retrospectives to discuss the use of work items, share best practices, and identify areas for improvement.
